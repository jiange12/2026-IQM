    "# The basics of using IQM Resonance\n",

    "You will have free access to IQM's cloud quantum computing platform, IQM Resonance, during this hackathon. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see how to connect to IQM Resonance and how to manage your jobs in different frameworks. For each framework, where these features are supported, you will learn to:\n",
    "- Connect to Resonance\n",
    "- Submit a job\n",
    "- Submit several circuits in the same job\n",
    "- Retrieve jobs you have already finished\n",
    "\n",
    "The frameworks currently listed in this tutorial are:\n",
    "- Qrisp\n",
    "- CUDA-Q\n",
    "- Qiskit\n",
    "- Cirq\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to use any of them for this challenge, or any other framework that supports IQM Resonance as a backend.\n",

    "If you run into any problems (there are lots of things that can go wrong here!), please get in touch with an IQM mentor."

    "\n",
    "You will need to set up a **Python 3.11 or 3.12** runtime environment, neither of which is the most recent Python version, with the appropriate packages installed. You will need to either:\n",
    "- Install one of these Python versions from the Python website\n",
    "- Set up a conda or other virtual environment in one of these versions\n",
    "- Run your code via qBraid (see the qBraid tutorial from Friday)\n",
    "- Run your code via Google Colab, in which case you should change the runtime type to 2025.07.\n",

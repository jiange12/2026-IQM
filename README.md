Group: Tristan Carter, Andrew Lee, Eugene Jiang, Stanley Chen

As part of the 2026 iQuHACKs IQM challenge, built this project in order to prove quantum entanglement on IQM's quantum hardware across, across many qualitative states, while also trying to entangle as many qubits as possible.

Our group was able to entangle 21 qubits and effectively proved entanglement on IQM's Crystal 54 quantum machine online via the IQM Resonance software.
